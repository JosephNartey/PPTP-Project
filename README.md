# PPTP-Project
Instructions.

This Repository consisted of work done for Michael Shiloh by Joseph Nartey Opey
Inside the code is comments on how to run the code:
You can replicate the same code for both sender and receiver as it is bi-directional video and audio transmission.
1. Copy code and run on mozilla browser for sender

2. Copy code again and run from another folder on mozilla browser on the same computer or another computer (preferably another computer)

3.Create a vidyio account (as am using vidyo webrtc api) to generate token for both sender and reciever.

4. Specify the user name for both token generation say (user1 for sender and user2 for reciever)

5 Specify same room name for both sender and reciever .

6. Hit the connect button on sender to allow camera and sound and to view live video.

7. Hit connect button on reciever to connect to the room name of the sender and there you have a bidirectional audio and video transmission.

Please let me know if you have any questions setting this up and am ready to help.

Please do let me know if you need any help running the webrtc, we can even experiment where you set up a sender in abu dhabi and i set up a reciever from Ghana to communicate via webrtc. Thank you.
